# Raggedy Calculator

### My mini-project to create a *(CLI)* calculator in rust.
The main goal is to implement proper support for parenthasis and correct order of calculations *(PEMDAS)*

Eventual extra goals: 
- GUI
- more complex functions
- perhaps solve for x functionality and more
- higher precision in results with floats
- Store precise numbers as fractions or exacat representations like sqrt(2)
